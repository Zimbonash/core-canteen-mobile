--- This is a workaround for the setSheetLargestUndimmedDetent iOS crash
--- The issue is that React Native tries to set a property that doesn't exist
---
--- To fix this, you need to:
--- 1. Update to Expo SDK 52 or later (which uses React Native 0.76+)
--- 2. OR add the following to your app.json:

Add this to app.json under "expo.plugins":

  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "ios": {
          "deploymentTarget": "15.0"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]

Then run: npm install expo-build-properties

OR the quick fix: Rebuild the iOS app with the latest pods
